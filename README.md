# A-Bot
This is my attempt at a Discord bot. If it has any bugs, please open an issue.

YOU MAY NOT SELL ANY PORTION OF THIS BOT!

# Screenshots
Here are just a few screenshots of a couple commands!

# You may use my bot...
I have nothing special, but I ask that you link to me in some way, shape, or form. I simply ask that you credit me by linking C-Apex (GitHub).

# Setup
`git clone` it to your machine.

`npm i` in the working directory to install dependencies.

# Config

Set token in `config/token.json`

Add welcome message (optional) in `config/welcome.json`

Channels specific to commands and other possible future functions can be defined in `config/channels.json`

Customize branding in `config/branding.json`

Set owner ID and command prefix in `config/admin.json`

# Operation
It is highly reccomended that you install PM2, a node process manager.

**Note:** The webhook must be created after the bot's startup and before usage of .h.x commands.
