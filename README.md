# A-Bot
This is my attempt at a Discord bot. If it has any bugs, please report them privately.

YOU MAY NOT SELL ANY PORTION OF THIS BOT! PLEASE FORK DERIVATIVES PUBLICLY! If you wish to contribute, please submit an issue!

# You may use my bot...
I have nothing special, but I ask that you link to me in some way, shape, or form. I simply ask that you credit me by linking C-Apex (GitHub).

# Setup
`git clone` it to your machine.

`npm i` in the working directory to install dependencies.

Set token in config.json

Customize branding in commands/commandconf.json

It is highly reccomended that you install PM2, a node process manager.

**Note:** The webhook must be created after the bot's startup and before usage of .h.x commands.
