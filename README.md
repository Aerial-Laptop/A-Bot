# A-Bot
This is my attempt at a Discord bot. If it has any bugs, please report them privately.

YOU MAY NOT SELL ANY PORTION OF THIS BOT! PLEASE FORK DERIVATIVES PUBLICLY! If you wish to contribute, please contact me on Discord (Apex#4766)!

# Credits:
Commando.JS - Main command handler functionality.
Imgur - Image hosting.

# You may use my bot...
I have nothing special, but I ask that you link to me in some way, shape, or form. Great ideas come from great people. I did not do this on my own; I credited the people who chose to help me. We simply ask you do the same by linking the appropriate names in the CREDITS, plus C-Apex (GitHub).
(Note to future self;
The branding is in commands/commandconf.json
The webhook must be created after the botâ€™s addition and before usage of .h.x commands.
The token is in config.json)
